    <section>
          <p>The world was a radically different place during The Ancient Age. Humanity had just discovered 
        agriculture and began building small settlements now that they could stay in one place and maintain
        a great surplus of food. As the surplurs grew larger so, too, did the amount of people. Especially
        the amount of people who could specialize into more unique jobs from smithing to clothmaking to
        leading a religion and eventually...a nation.</p>

    <section>
        <p>Soon enough, these settlements turned into towns, and then into city-states. Each one with their own
        kings, clergy, jobs, military, and more. These city-states with the land of Mesopotamia; the land between
        two rivers (the Tigris and Euphrates) were rather advanced for their time and shared an over-arching culture,
        allowing them to compete with each other to become the great hegemon of Mesopotamia.</p>

        <p>That was the order of things in Mesopotamia. That is, until, a man named Sargon (whose name quite literally translates to "legitimate king")
      became the ruler of the city-state of Akkad. Through his rule, he conquered and unified all of Mesopotamia under the banner of Akkad, making
      him one of the first multi-territorial kings in human history. But nothing lasts forever, and after Sargon's death both internal and
      external threats began to eat away at the Akkadian Empire throughout the reign of multiple kings. This would lead into Mesopotamia
      becoming primarily split in the kingdoms of Assyria and Babylonia during <a href="bronze-age.html">The Bronze Age</a></p>
