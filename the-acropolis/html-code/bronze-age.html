    <p>The Bronze Age was an odd time in human history to say the least. The Bronze Age was simultaneously old and backwards
    yet also highly advanced. The land surrounding the cradle of civilization in Mesopotamia had become the territory
    of great empires, all with the best militaries using the prime resource of the age: Bronze.</p>

    <p>Each of these empires, Egypt in the south, The Hitties in the north, Assyria, The Mittani, and Babylonia to the east,
    even the Mycanaean Greeks all traded the resources needed to create bronze. Each of the empires had only a part of the 
    materials required to create bronze and as such had to trade with each other to build up their armies and maintain their
    defense. This would ultimately be their downfall as event after event during what would become the Bronze Age Collapse
    further isolated the empires from each other, driving them all into destruction and decay.</p>

    First it would be the Persians, and soon enough the one and only Alexander the Great.</p>
