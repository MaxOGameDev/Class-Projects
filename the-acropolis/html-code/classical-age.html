      <h2>The Classical Age: A Summary</h2>
    </header>
    <section>
    <p>This is likely the most well known, and most eventful, part of ancient history.
    With the collapse of the Brone Age empires, the ancient world had fallen into something of a
    dark age for a few hundred years. During those years, the city-states of Greece passed on their legends
    and began to regather the old knowledge while learning entirely new ideas. As the Greek cities eventually
    began flourishing once more into the ancient Greece we know today, an empire to the east was growing as well.
    The Perisans.</p>

    <p>These Persians made their way westward, evnetually threatening to conquer not only the extensions of the Greek city-states,
    but also the entirety of Greece. This is where we get the story of the 300 Spartans who stood in a failed attempt to hold back
    the Persians from conquering the entire region. They would get theirs though, with the rise of a general turned ambitious ruler from Macedonia.
    Alexander the Great.</p>

    <p>Alexander's military leadership pushed the Persians out of Greece, conquering it all under his own Macedonian Empire
    (though he technically never actually went about conquering Sparta. Seemingly because he thought that little of them at this point).
    Alexander's skill in combat led him to become a totally undefeated military leader, spreading his empire from Greece to the borders
    of the Mauryan Empire in India. As far as anyone can tell, the only reason he stopped was because his soldiers refused to fight any further
    and rebelled, forcing him to accept their wishes and march back home. Unfortunately, Alexander was killed by poisoning on the way.
    He had never chosen an heir, causing his generals to fight amongst themselves for control, leading to a war between the Diadochi, or the 
    successor states. Alexander's Empire would never be reforged.</p>

    <p>The rise of Alexander is typically seen as the beginning of the Classical Age, but the true embodiment of the era is a
    civilization like no other. A civilization that requires no introduction but gets one anyway, Rome!</p>

    <p>It's difficult to discuss Roman history in a single webpage. It would take an entirely new website dedicated to it to
    tell even half of its history. But in short, Rome began as a kingdom, a city founded by Greeks who supposedly escaped Troy
    during the Trojan Wars. The kingdom only lasted for a while before the citizens became fed up with their rulers and deposed him,
    turning Rome in a republic and swearing off kings forever (That didn't last forever). As we all know, Rome would grow and grow, soon becoming
    a grand empire the changed the course of history forever.</p>
