<h1>Research Questions And Answers:</h1>
    <p>How does a search engine work?</p>
        <p>Search engines use algorithms to scan the internet and find webpages, ranking the results based on comparing what was typed in
        to the search bar and what was tagged in the webpages code.</p>
    <p>Why do different search engines give different ranking to websites with the same search phrase?</p>
        <p>Certain search engines use slightly different algorithms and have different ideas as to what gets priority. For instance, there are paid
        ads that are relevan to the search that pop up first on Google whereas on something like DuckDuckGo looks for sites not only relevant but also
        commonly visited.</p>
    <p>What is a meta tag and what is the purpose for the keyword and description meta tags?</p>
        <p>Meta tags are a special piece of code added into a website that can alter the way they appear in search results.
        Keyword and Description tags effectively tell search engines about the content of the website and what words/searches
        to associate it with.</p>
    <p>Why might you include meta tags in your pages and do meta tags improve your pages searchability and ranking?</p>
        <p>Meta tags have a good chance of improving your searchability and ranking but only for the types of searches
        those tags tailor to. The whole point of using them is to make sure your website reaches your target audience.</p>
    <p>What are several ways that you can publicize your personal website project?</p>
        <p>Advertisements on other websites, proper meta tagging, and generally making a good website.</p>
