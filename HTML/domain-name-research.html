<h1>What Is An Internet Domain Name?</h1>
<p>An internet domain name is the name of the website/the URL you must type in to reach the website.</p>
<h1>Why Are Domain Names So Important On The Web?</h1>
<p>Domain names help organize the internet and allow for websites to actually be reachable by anyone from anywhere
(relatively speaking)</p>
<h1>Why Do Domain Names Have To Be Unique?</h1>
<p>If two domain names were the exact same then there would be no way to find out 
exactly which website you're trying to go to.</p>
<h1>What Does It Mean To Register A Domain Name?</h1>
<p>Registering a domain name means identifying an IP Address with a name to use in URLs to reach it.</p>
<h1>How Do You Acquire An Already Taken Domain Name?</h1>    
<p>You must purchase the domain from the person who currently holds the name.</p>
